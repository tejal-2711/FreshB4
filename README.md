## Inspiration
Research shows that approximately 35-38% food supply is wasted in the United States, and a US household wastes an average of over 250 pounds of food annually. A family of four can lose approximately $1500 - $3000 per year due to food waste. This waste has a large carbon footprint as it wastes the water, land, and energy used in production and transport. When discarded food and produce break down in landfills, they generates methane that traps more heat in the atmosphere than carbon dioxide! 

As college students with busy workloads and schedules, managing our groceries is a task. We often feel frustrated with being unable to manage our groceries and having to trash produce. Brainstorming about ideas, we all knew we wanted to solve this problem and create a sustainable solution. So we came up with FreshB4! It improves **sustainability**, helping users reduce food wastage and their **carbon footprint**. It also enables users to consume fresh groceries enhancing **food safety** and enriching users lives.

## What it does
- Allows users to capture or upload pictures of items and returns a freshness analysis.
- Lets users keep track of items in their pantry with associated "days to spoilage", "expiry date", "spoiled status", and a "short description".
- Users can see their overall pantry health and how many items in their pantry need immediate attention.
- Users can also get AI generated recipes for utilizing the "urgent items" with detailed description of steps, time it takes, and difficulty level.
- Let's users store store long term pantry items in a database and feed items into the database right after capturing/uploading images.

## How we built it
- We used react-native a full stack mobile application that allows users to upload or capture picture, and view freshness analyses.
- We leveraged Gemini API to integrate an LLM in our app to perform the freshness analysis, give the user recommendations, and detailed recipes.
